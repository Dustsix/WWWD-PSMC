# WWWD-PSMC Project/Fall Practical Computing BIOL 6220
The 10x Genomics Chromium platform allows for whole genome production using linked-reads, potentially providing high resolution in previously difficult to reconstruct regions of the genome. For this project, we use 10x data from a White-winged Wood Duck to generate a whole genome to be used in a Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) evaluation.
 
Overview of De Novo Assembly Software

Supernova is a software package for de novo assembly from Chromium Linked-Reads that are made from a single whole-genome library from an individual DNA source. A key feature of Supernova is that it creates diploid assemblies, thus separately representing maternal and paternal chromosomes over very long distances. Almost all other methods instead merge homologous chromosomes into single incorrect 'consensus' sequences. Supernova is the only practical method for creating diploid assemblies of large genomes.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
