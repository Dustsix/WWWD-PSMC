# WWWD-PSMC Project/Fall Practical Computing BIOL 6220
The 10x Genomics Chromium platform allows for whole genome production using linked-reads, potentially providing high resolution in previously difficult to reconstruct regions of the genome. For this project, we use 10x data from a White-winged Wood Duck to generate a whole genome to be used in a Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC) evaluation.
 
Overview of De Novo Assembly Software

Supernova is a software package for de novo assembly from Chromium Linked-Reads that are made from a single whole-genome library from an individual DNA source. A key feature of Supernova is that it creates diploid assemblies, thus separately representing maternal and paternal chromosomes over very long distances. Almost all other methods instead merge homologous chromosomes into single incorrect 'consensus' sequences. Supernova is the only practical method for creating diploid assemblies of large genomes.

### De Novo Assembly Software

Supernova is a software package for de novo assembly from Chromium Linked-Reads that are made from a single whole-genome library from an individual DNA source. A key feature of Supernova is that it creates diploid assemblies, thus separately representing maternal and paternal chromosomes over very long distances. Almost all other methods instead merge homologous chromosomes into single incorrect 'consensus' sequences. Supernova is the only practical method for creating diploid assemblies of large genomes.

#### supernova mkfastq 

Wraps Illumina's bcl2fastq to correctly demultiplex Chromium-prepared sequencing samples and to convert barcode and read data to FASTQ files.

#### supernova run 

Takes FASTQ files containing barcoded reads from supernova mkfastq and builds a graph-based assembly.

```
example: 
 supernova run --id=${SAMPLE}_assembly --fastqs=/$SPECIES/${SAMPLE}_fastq --maxreads=600000000 --localcores 36 --localmem 600
 
  --id	A unique run ID string
  --fastqs	Path of the FASTQ folder generated by supernova mkfastq
  --sample	(optional) Can be used to select only a single sample of those specified in the sample sheet supplied to mkfastq. 
  --maxreads	(optional) Downsample if more than the specified number of reads is provided. (default: 1.2B reads)
  --localcores	(optional) limits concurrent sections of Supernova to use the specified number of cores.
  --localmem	(optional) limits memory use on shared systems where Supernova may attempt to use more resources than a user is     allowed. 

```

#### supernova mkoutput

Command to generate a FASTA file representing your assembly.

```
example: --style=pseudohap
 The pseudohap style generates a single record per scaffold

```

## Burrows-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) Tool

BWA is a software package for mapping low-divergent sequences against a large reference genome, such as the human genome.  

### BWA-MEM

Recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more accurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp Illumina reads.

```
example: 
 bwa mem ref.fa read1.fq read2.fq > aln-pe.sam
 
example: 
 bwa mem ../WWWD.1.fasta -t 4 4905-CB-0004_S1_L001_R1_001_val_1.fq.gz 4905-CB-0004_S1_L001_R2_001_val_2.fq.gz > WWWD_510.sam

```

## SAMtools (Sequence Alignment/Map)

Samtools is a set of utilities that manipulate alignments in the BAM format.

### SAMtools view

With no options or regions specified, prints all alignments in the specified input alignment file (in SAM, BAM, or CRAM format) to standard output in SAM format (with no header).

Converting SAM directly to a sorted BAM file.

```
example:
 samtools view -bS file.sam | samtools sort - file_sorted
 
example:
 samtools view -bS -@4 WWWD_510.sam | samtools sort -  -@4 -o WWWD_510_sorted.bam
  -b Output in the BAM format
  -S Ignore for compatibility with previous samtools versions
```

### SAMtools mpileup

Generate VCF, BCF or pileup for one or multiple BAM files.

```
example: 
 samtools mpileup -C50 -uf ref.fa aln.bam | bcftools view -c -  | vcfutils.pl vcf2fq -d 10 -D 100 | gzip > diploid.fq.gz

example:
 samtools mpileup -C50 -uf WWWD.1.fasta ./4905-CB-0004/WWWD_510_sorted.bam | bcftools call -c - | vcfutils.pl vcf2fq -d10 -D100 | gzip > WWWD510.diploid.fq.gz  
  -d sets and minimum read depth and -D sets the maximum (recommended to set -d to a third of the average depth and -D to twice)
  diploid.fq.gz is the whole-genome diploid consensus sequence of one individual,  generated by samtools mpileup
```
